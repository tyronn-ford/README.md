I am a recent fellow to HSOC Cyber where I am gaining real world experience in cybersecurity working on home lab and projects. I am learning about hardening my home network, creating my home SOC, using VM Box with Kali Linux to attack my network. I recently completed my CompTIA Security + certification in November of 2025 and looking to gain more skills and certification is cloud security.
